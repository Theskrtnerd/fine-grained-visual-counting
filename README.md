# Fine-grained Visual Counting

This project is part of our research course "Topics in Computer Science" at the University of Adelaide.
The project's goal for this semester is to create a custom dataset and test its results on a few different SOTA models.
Right now, we only have the code for the CountGD model, and we will update more in the future.

## How To Use

Install the Dataset folder from Google Drive and unzip it.

Run the create_dataset.py file

Clone the CountGD repo

Run the test_dataset.py file
